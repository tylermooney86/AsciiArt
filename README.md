-------
Clone the Repository

In a terminal type: "python ascii.py" (Language: Python3: Dependencies: PIL)

Menus 
---------
### Select Image:

    prints a list of images stored in images folder
### Generate Ascii Art:
    Two output modes:
        Monochrome: uses two char to render image
        Grayscale: uses many char to render image
### Settings:
    Character Lists:
        Change Character List:
            Customize character lists used to render ascii art
            Do not separate characters
                I recommend using smaller character sets for grayscale set and dont for get the space(' ')
            Monochrome only takes two characters in the order they are entered
            Grayscale takes many characters and orders them by density of the character
        Invert Character List:
            Reverses the order of the characters in character list
    Dimensions:
        Change dimensions of output
            input should be in the form: width,height (ie: 80,40 or characters,lines)
            entering an incorrectly formatted value will cause program to use input image's dimensions
    Brightness/Contrast:
        Takes float values:
            1.0 = no brightness/contrast Change
            0.0 = black image
            >1.0 = high contrast/Brightness
            not a number = None
### View Generated Images:

    Prints selected text file to console
